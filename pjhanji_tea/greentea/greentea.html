    <p> The objective of this project is to make a website. I am thinking about making an interactive website about tea. You choose the type of tea you would like, click on any type of tea, and it will link you to another link. For example, the green tea container led you to this page. There will be a mug with warm water on the screen, and when you hover over a tea bag, it will go down into the mug, and the water will change color. Once the tea bag has made contact with the mug, there will be facts and information about tea at the bottom of the screen. Goal is to practice both html and css. If I can incorporate javascript, that would be even cooler. I want to make a proper website, but make it fun as well, so I think throughout the weeks I have with this project, I can build whatever we have done in this class, and use it to continue this project. </p>
