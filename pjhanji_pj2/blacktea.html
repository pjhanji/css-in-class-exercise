<h3>Black Tea</h3><br>
<p>China is the birthplace of black tea, which in China is called, perhaps more appropriately, hong cha – red tea – after its the red colored tea it usually produces.  It's history in China can be traced back to the late Ming Dynasty, around the year 1590, when the first black tea – Lapsang Souchong – was produced in the area around Wuyi Mountain in Fujian province.  This high mountainous area was called Lapsang and the small leaf tea trees Souchong – hence the name.  Today China's best and most well known black teas include Fujian Lapsang Souchong, Fujian Minhong, Anhui Keemun, Yunnan Dianhong, Guangdong Yingteh and Sichuan Mabian Gongfu black teas.
Keemun black tea is arguably China's most famous black tea, and was first made in 1875 in Qimen county by Hu Yuanlong who journeyed to Fujian to learn tea making.  When he returned to Qimen he began locally producing his own tea, that soon became known as Keemun black tea, and went on to become one of the most sort after black teas in China. <br>
    
The history of black tea in Europe began in the 17th century when European explorers first reached China.  The first documented record of tea in Europe is from 1610, when Dutch merchants first brought back Chinese black tea from China, and then sold it widely all around Europe.  In England it was at first considered a “mysterious oriental drink” and sold at very high prices that only the aristocracy could afford.  From this beginning it was became a drink that marked the well to do, and so became popular as a drink to indicate your wealth and position in society.

    <p>INGREDIENTS:<br>
Black Tea bags<br>
Water<br>
Sugar<br>
Milk<br>
</p><br>

<p>DIRECTIONS<br>
Bring water to boil and add the tea bags, sugar, anise starts, cardamom pod and cloves. Stir until all the sugar disolves. Gently boil tea for about 3 minutes. Remove from heat.
Allow tea to steep for at least 30 minutes and allow it to cool. The more concentrated the tea flavor, the better the Thai tea tastes. We prefer to allow the tea bags to seep for about 2 hours for maximum flavor. During this time, the thai tea can cool. Remove the tea bags and spoon out the anise starts, cardamom pod and cloves. If tea is still warm, we will refrigerate it so it can be chilled. You can make this ahead of time and have the organic Thai tea chilling in the fridge. Fill glasses with ice and pour in organic Thai tea leaving enough room to fill in your half and half (or other creamer). For an 8 oz. glass we like to add about 2-3 tablespoons of half and half for a creamier flavor.</p>
