            <h3>Rooibos Tea's shaky beginnings</h3>
            <p>Rooibos tea's history is rooted in the Cederberg region of beautiful South Africa. Khoisans, the indigenous Bushmen of the region, harvested the leaves from the Aspalathus Linearis plant for centuries. The leaves were used as herbal remedies for many ailments, and loved for their delicious taste.<br>
            <br>
            Rooibos tea history nearly ended with the dwindling of the Khoisan tribes, but thankfully a botanist named Carl Humberg rediscovered the leaves in 1772 and revived a more widespread interest in the tea drink. Then, in 1904 a Russian immigrant with ties to tea manufacturing, Benjamin Ginsberg, began marketing the drink as a "Mountain Tea," an herbal alternative to tea.<br>
            <br>
            In recent years, rooibos tea history has shown that the tea will continue to be more esteemed and fashionable among tea enthusiasts worldwide, and this is due especially to many people's more health-conscious attitudes. In the past few years, demand for rooibos tea has increased by more than fifty percent. And though rooibos tea is most popular in African, Asian and European countries, its popularity is definitely spreading to the Americas and beyond. The more that's discovered about rooibos tea's health benefits, the more people want more of this delectable beverage.
