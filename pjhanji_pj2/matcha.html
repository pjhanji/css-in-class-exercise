<h3>Matcha Tea</h3><br>
<p>The development and cultivation of green tea is thought to have begun sometime in the Tang Dynasty (7-10th century) where the tea was harvested and formed into tea bricks which were created for storage and for the efficient transportation of the tea over long distances.<br>

Initially the tea was prepared by roasting and pulverizing, then followed by decocting the resulting tea powder in hot water, adding salt. From these origins the process evolved until the grinding of steamed green tea became popular in the Song Dynsaty (10th–13th Century). The method of making powdered tea from steam-prepared dried tea leaves, and preparing the beverage by whipping the tea powder and hot water together in a bowl became popular in the latter part of the 12th century.<br>

The Zen Buddhists were very aware of the meditational benefits of this "Matcha" green tea, which brought to them a greater sense of clarity and well-being.<br>

They found that in drinking this tea before their afternoon meditations that it enabled them to be much more "centered", "focused", and maintain a level of sustained energy throughout the afternoon which they had never experienced before. This special green tea eventually became known as "Matcha, the Ceremonial tea of the temple high priests".<br>

Along with this development, tea plantation owners in Japan continued to perfect the process for developing and maximizing the most potent and therapeutically beneficial Matcha.<br>

Because of this the general populace at large drank only what was called, Bancha (Houjicha), which has a brown color, and which was much more bitter to taste and lacked that beautiful resilient green color of the precious Matcha tea.

<p>DIRECTIONS<br>
Meet your matcha accessories: a handmade bamboo whisk (called a chasen), a tea bowl (matcha-chawan), a measuring ladle (chashaku), a tea strainer, and—of course—your matcha powder.
        
To brew a cup, scoop 1½ ladlefuls (about 2 grams, or 1½ teaspoons) matcha powder into your strainer.
        
Sift your matcha powder into your tea bowl, swirling the powder around the strainer with your ladle. This will ensure there are no clumps so your tea will be smooth.

After you've sifted your powder, it should look like this. Pretty, right?

Pour boiling water (about 2 ounces) into a teacup, then let it sit until it cools down to about 180–190 degrees (about a minute). Carefully pour the hot water into the bowl with the matcha powder.

Using your chasen, whisk to combine your tea. Relax your wrist, then whisk in a gentle circular motion for thin, smooth tea, and in a brisk "M" or "W"-shaped motion for foamy tea. (Fun fact: Smooth and foamy tea both have slightly different scents and flavors.) Whisk for about 10–15 seconds until the tea is bright green.
        
Carefully pour your matcha into a teacup.Here's the finished foamy matcha tea. Make sure to drink it right after you've prepared it—the powder will settle at the bottom after a while.</p>
