    <h3>What is yellow tea</h3>
            <p>Yellow tea is a rare type of tea which is slowly gaining recognition in western countries. It is produced only in China with a long history. As the name suggests, yellow tea is yellow in color—both the leaves and the infusion. This color is acquired by adding an extra step during production, called "Sealed Yellowing," which is a slow oxidation process of tea polyphenols such as catechin. This unique step make it weet, mellow and bright yellow in color, while without any hint of grassy taste characteristic of green tea.<br>
            <br>
            After the tea has been picked, tea makers let the tea breathe under shade, evenly piled on bamboo sheets for 5-6 hours. The leaves will lose about 5% of their moisture. 300 grams of fresh leaves are fried at a time on a shallow, 20 degree sloped wok. The temperature of the wok is not as hot as green tea, only about 120 Celsius. The tea maker will fry the leaves for about five minutes, and then let the temperature of the leaves start to drop. They will sweep the leaves into a 40-centimeter thick layer on woven bamboo trays.  The trays are shaken to remove dust and broken leaves and disperse heat, the leaves are then left to cool for 30 minutes.
